# PyCharm/GitHub Setup Check

## Problem Description
The purpose of this exercise is to be sure everything is set up correctly and to show you how to navigate GitHub and PyCharm. The code is provided for you - all you need to do is make one small edit.

* Uncomment (remove the #) the print statement. Be sure there are no spaces between the margin and the print statement.
* Run the program by going to the Run menu and clicking Run. (There are 2 Run options in the menu. The first one will probably be greyed out - choose the second one.) You can also right-click on the code and choose Run.
  * If you have an error message, ask for help.

### Submitting to GitHub
* There are several steps to this. It takes practice, and will get easier to remember as you do it more often.
  * **Commit**  This command stores the changes you have made. You can think of it like taking a snapshot of your changes. They are saved but nothing else happens...yet. To commit, click the green ✔ in the toolbar at the top of the PyCharm window. Look for the prompt to type a commit message - this is where you will note the changes you made and the status of the project. For this assignment, something like `uncomment print - finished` is fine. Then click Commit.
  * **Push** This sends your commit ("snapshot") to GitHub and keeps it as the current working version of your project. Click the green arrow (points up and to the right) next to the commit button. Then click Push.
    * Note: There is also the option to Commit and Push at the same time. For now, I recommend doing them in 2 steps.
 
 ### Check GitHub
 * Go to your repo in GitHub and check to be sure it was updated in the last couple minutes.
 * Look for a yellow dot, green check or red X. Those symbols indicate the automatic testing status. Yellow means the tests are running. The green check means the tests have passed and the red X means the tests failed becuase there is an error somewhere.
  * If you see a yellow dot, refresh the screen until the tests finish and you see the result. 

### Submit confirmation on Canvas
* The last step is to submit a confirmation message on Canvas that you are done and the tests have passed (if there are tests).

### This will get easier!😊🦉
